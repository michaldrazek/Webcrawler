# Webcrawler
It is a simple webcrawler I've made using the Python framework - Scrapy. It also works on cloudflare protected sites, simply waiting for a timeout. The site it was used on is now dead and it won't work with any other page layout but it still can be used as a boilerplate for similar task.
